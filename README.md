# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:it is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods,tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):consists of several stages, gathering requirements,desinging,implementing, testing, deployment and maintining of the software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
collect all needed materials, create a high level and detailed design,implement the design, test to make sure its working, deploy it and maintain it
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:agile is flexible,collaborative and responds well to changes
waterfall is lengthy, and rigid

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:waterfall is takes a sequential approach, it lengthy and rigid, agile is flexible and mostly applies to small assignments

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:its a design principle in softwareengineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the comonents of a system

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:unit testing is the initial test to confirm whether it working, intergration testing is when components of the software are gradually intergrated, system testing is conducted on the complete system to evaluate its behavior and performance, and accentance testing is done to test whether it meets its user requirement

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:its the process of tracking and managing changes to software code. it to see whether it  meets the end user needs, to change where necessary or improve its capabilities

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: the soft ware mananger, develops a team, hires developers, prepares techinal proposals and reports and leads the team.
the challenges faced by a software mananger includes, hiring/getting enough talent, managing a diverse team, avoiding micromanagement, keeping the team motivated, handling generational differences among others.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:software maintainancce is the process of changing,modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
corrective software maintenance- if its faulty, preventive- to avoid breaking down in the future, perfective- to enhance its capability and adaptive maintenance

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Acceptance risk, environmental health issues, data integrity, conflict of interest among others
To ensure adherence to ethical standards engineers should striveto create inclusive and accesible software thats accomodative to all, adhere to privacy, accuracy and quality of the product.
